### Introduction

Brunsli is a lossless JPEG repacking library.

Brunsli allows for a 22% decrease in file size while allowing the original
JPEG to be recovered byte-by-byte.

VERY GOOD NEWS: Brunsli is on its way to become standardized. Brunsli has been specified as the lossless JPEG transport layer in the [Committee Draft of JPEG XL Image Coding System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03565) and is ready to power faster and more economical transfer and storage of photographs.

We are committed making JPEG XL a first-class citizen of the open-source and closed-source worlds, and we will integrate it into image and networking related tools.

The currently planned/on-going integration work includes:

- [x] one-shot C API / dynamic library
- [x] WASM module
- [ ] Node.js module
- [x] Java bindings
- [x] Python libraries support (OpenCV, imageio, PythonMagic, PIL, etc.)
- [ ] Python bindings
- [ ] Nginx transcoding module
- [x] Nginx serving module
- [ ] Apache transcoding module
- [x] Apache serving module

Stay tuned!
